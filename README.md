# biking2

## Abstract

This is a project where i try out Java 8, Spring / Spring Boot and AngularJS. The project is live at [biking.michael-simons.eu][1]. To find out more, checkout the [about page][2] or start reading the series of blog posts:

[Developing a web application with Spring Boot, AngularJS and Java 8][3]

You may also want to have a look at the client companion of this app, [BikingFX][4]

## Architecture 

The projects architecture is [completely documented][6] inside the [arc42][7] structure, using the AsciiDoc format from the [arc42-template][8].

## NOTE

You'll need [GPSBabel][5] to build this project without errors and to use the tracks / log database. Errors running the `TracksControllerTest` are the result of a missing `gpsbabel` binary in the path.

Per default, biking2 looks at `/opt/local/bin/gpsbabel` for the GPSBabel binary. This can be overwritten by adding an application.properties to the root of the project containing the following property:

    biking2.gpsBabel = path/to/gpsbabel/binary

GPSBabel is available for all major operating systems, including windows. So please check if it's available on your platform if biking2 doesn't compile for you.
