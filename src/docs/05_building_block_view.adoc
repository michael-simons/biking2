== Building Block View

The application packaged as _biking2.jar_ contains two (the api and the spa) of three main parts, as shown in the <<Business Context>>:

image::5.0_level0.png[align="center"]

From those two we have a closer look at the api only. For details regarding the structure of an AngularJS 1.2.x application, have a look at their https://code.angularjs.org/1.2.28/docs/guide[developers guide].

NOTE: To comply with the Java coding style guidelines, the modules "bikingPictures" and "galleryPictures" reside in the Java packages "bikingpictures" and "gallerypictures".

=== Whitebox biking2::api

The following diagram shows the main building blocks of the system and their interdependencies:

image::5.1_level1-biking_api.png[align="center"]

I used _functional decomposition_ to separate responsibilities. The single parts of the api are all encapsulated in their own components, represented as Java packages.

All components depend on a standard JPA EntityManager and some on local file storage. I won't go into detail for those blackboxes.

=== Building Blocks - Level 2

==== bikes (Whitebox)

image::5.2_level2-bikes.png[align="center"]

The `BikeRepository` is a Spring Data JPA based repository for `BikeEntities`. The `BikeController` and the `ChartsController` access it to retrieve and store instances of `BikeEntity` and provide external interfaces.

Contained blackboxes::

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| highcharts | Contains logic for generating configurations and definitions for http://www.highcharts.com[Highcharts] on the server side.
|===

==== tracks (Whitebox)

image::5.2_level2-tracks.png[align="center"]

The `TrackRepository` is a Spring Data JPA based repository for `TrackEntities`. The `TracksController` and the `OembedController` access it to retrieve and store instances of `TrackEntity` and provide external interfaces.

Contained blackboxes::

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| gpx | Generated _JAXB_ classes for parsing GPX files. Used by the `TracksController` to retrieve the surrounding rectangle (envelope) for new tracks.
|===

==== trips (Whitebox)

image::5.2_level2-trips.png[align="center"]

The `AssortedTripRepository` is a Spring Data JPA based repository for `AssortedTripEntities`. The `TripsController` accesses it to retrieve and store instances of `TrackEntity` and provide external interfaces.

==== locations (Whitebox)

image::5.2_level2-locations.png[align="center"]

Locations are stored and read via a Spring Data JPA based repository named `LocationRepository`. This repository is only accessed through the `LocationService`. The `LocationService` provides real time updates for connected clients through a `SimpMessagingTemplate` and the `LocationController` uses the service to provide access to all locations created within the last 30 minutes.

New locations are created by the service either through a REST interface in form of the `LocationController` or via a `MessageListener` on a MQTT channel.

==== bikingPictures (Whitebox)

image::5.2_level2-bikingPictures.png[align="center"]

A Spring Data JPA repository named `BikingPicturesRepository` is used for all access to `BikingPictureEntities`, the external REST api for reading pictures is implemented with `BikingPicturesController`. The RSS feed is read from `FetchBikingPicturesJob` by using a JAXBContext "rss". The URLs to the image files which may are protected by various means are provided to the job via a `DailyFratzeProvider`.

Contained blackboxes::

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| rss | Generated _JAXB_ classes for parsing RSS feeds. Used by the `FetchBikingPicturesJob` to read the contents of an RSS feed.
|===

==== galleryPictures (Whitebox)

image::5.2_level2-galleryPictures.png[align="center"]

The `GalleryPictureRepository` is a Spring Data JPA based repository for `GalleryPictureEntities`. The `GalleryController` accesses it to retrieve and store instances of `GalleryPictureEntity` and provide external interfaces.

==== statistics (Whitebox)

The `StatisticService` is a database centric service that uses an instance of jOOQ's `DSLContext` for creating SQL.
That SQL is not generated SQL, but handcrafted.
jOOQ is used only to do this in a types safe way.

During build, jOOQ reads a temporary database, created from SQL based migration scripts, and provides several Java classes reassembling a schema.
Those classes along with the DSL are used to write SQL.

The statements make heavily use of analytic functions.
This is necessary, as the original decision for storing milages has been not storing the amount biked each month, but the accumulated milage on a bike.
Therefore, the monthly values need to be computed.

This is done by queries like the following

[source,sql]
[[generate-maven-project]]
.Query that provides the statistics for the current year
----
WITH mm AS (
  SELECT
    bikes.name,
    bikes.color,
    milages.recorded_on,
    (lead(milages.amount) OVER (PARTITION BY bikes.id ORDER BY milages.recorded_on) - milages.amount) value
  FROM bikes
    JOIN milages
      ON milages.bike_id = bikes.id
  ORDER BY milages.recorded_on ASC
)
SELECT
  mm.name,
  mm.color,
  (EXTRACT(MONTH FROM mm.recorded_on) - 1) idx,
  mm.value,
  sum(mm.value) OVER (PARTITION BY mm.recorded_on) total
FROM mm
WHERE (
  mm.value IS NOT NULL
  AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM mm.recorded_on) >= EXTRACT(YEAR FROM DATE '2019-01-01')
)
ORDER BY mm.name ASC
