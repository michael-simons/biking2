== Building Block View

The application packaged as _biking2.jar_ contains two (the api and the spa) of three main parts, as shown in the <<Business Context>>:

From those two we have a closer look at the api only. For details regarding the structure of an AngularJS 1.2.x application, have a look at their https://code.angularjs.org/1.2.28/docs/guide[developers guide].

=== Whitebox biking2::api

The following diagram shows the main building blocks of the system and their interdependencies:

image::5.1_level1-biking_api.png[align="center"]

I used _functional decomposition_ to separate responsibilities. The single parts of the api are all encapsulated in their own components, represented as Java packages.

All components depend on a standard JPA EntityManager and some on local file storage. I won't go into detail for those blackboxes.

Contained blackboxes::

=== Building Blocks - Level 2

==== bikes (Whitebox)

image::5.2_level2-bikes.png[align="center"]

The `BikeRepository` is a Spring Data JPA based repository for `BikeEntities`. The `BikeController` and the `ChartsController` access it to retrieve and store instances of `BikeEntity` and provide external interfaces.

Contained blackboxes::

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| highcharts | Contains logic for generating configurations and definitions for http://www.highcharts.com[Highcharts] on the server side.
|===

==== tracks (Whitebox)

image::5.2_level2-tracks.png[align="center"]

The `TrackRepository` is a Spring Data JPA based repository for `TrackEntities`. The `TracksController` and the `OembedController` access it to retrieve and store instances of `TrackEntity` and provide external interfaces.

Contained blackboxes::

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| gpx | Generated _JAXB_ classes for parsing GPX files. Used by the `TracksController` to retrieve the surrounding rectangle (envelope) for new tracks.
|===

==== trips (Whitebox)

image::5.2_level2-trips.png[align="center"]

The `AssortedTripRepository` is a Spring Data JPA based repository for `AssortedTripEntities`. The `TripsController` accesses it to retrieve and store instances of `TrackEntity` and provide external interfaces.

==== locations (Whitebox)

image::5.2_level2-locations.png[align="center"]

Locations are stored and read via a Spring Data JPA based repository named `LocationRepository`. This repository is only accessed through the `LocationService`. The `LocationService` provides real time updates for connected clients through a `SimpMessagingTemplate` and the `LocationController` uses the service to provide access to all locations created within the last 30 minutes.

New locations are created through the service either through a REST interface in form of the `LocationController` or via a `MessageListener` on a MQTT channel.

==== bikingPictures (Whitebox)

image::5.2_level2-bikingPictures.png[align="center"]

A Spring Data JPA repository `BikingPicturesRepository` is used for all access to `BikingPictureEntities`, the external REST api for reading pictures is implemented with `BikingPicturesController`. The RSS feed is read from `FetchBikingPicturesJob` by using a JAXBContext "rss". The URLs to the image files which may are protected by various means are provided to the job via a `DailyFratzeProvider`.

Contained blackboxes::

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| rss | Generated _JAXB_ classes for parsing RSS feeds. Used by the `FetchBikingPicturesJob` to read the contents of an RSS feed.
