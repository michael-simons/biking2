=== Evaluation Scenarios

.Testability / Coverage

By using _JaCoCo_ during http://info.michael-simons.eu/2014/05/22/jacoco-maven-and-netbeans-8-integration/[development and the build process] ensure a code coverage of at least 95%.

.Testability / Independent from external services

The architecture should be designed in such a way that algorithms depending on external services can be tested without having the external service available. That is: All external dependencies should be mockable.

Example: `FetchBikingPicturesJob` needs a resource containing a RSS feed. Retrieving the resource and parsing it are at least two different tasks. Fetching the resource through a separate class `DailyFratzeProvider` makes testing the actual parsing independent from a HTTP connection and thus relatively simple.
