	    <h2>About</h2>
	    <p>This application is written in <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> and uses <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> and <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>.</p>
	    <p>The chart is created using the amazing <a href="http://www.highcharts.com">Highcharts JS</a> library and the map is based on Google Maps.</p>
	    <p>I made heavily use of Sinatras inline templates and therefore the whole application is, although a full mvc based application, one single file still way under 1000 lines, including all model and css code.</p>
	    <p>All view code is written using <a href="http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/">Haml</a> respectively Sass, including the auto-refreshing JavaScript Code, so no XHTML pollutes this source file.</p>
