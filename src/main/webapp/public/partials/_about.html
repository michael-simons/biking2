	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>This application is written in <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html">Java</a>. The backend is created with <a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/">Spring Boot</a>, <a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-data-jpa/">Spring Data JPA</a> and protected <a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-security/">Spring Security</a>. The frontend is written created with <a href="http://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a> except a little part for embedded maps.</p>
	
	<p>I've blogged about my goals rewriting the old application from scratch here <a href="">Developing a web application with Spring Boot, AngularJS and Java 8</a>, the source code is available here <a href="http://michael-simons.eu/stuff/biking2-sources.jar">biking2-sources.jar</a>. In case anyone is interested, i'd probably publish the repository on GitHub as well.
	
	<p>Until early 2014 this application was <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> based and consisted mainly of one big *.rb file. The blog post about the old application is still online here: <a href="http://info.michael-simons.eu/2009/07/29/creating-a-self-containing-mvc-application-with-sinatra/">Creating a self containing mvc application with Sinatra</a>, together with the old <a target="_self" href="/misc/biking.rb">source code</a>.</p>
