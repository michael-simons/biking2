	<p>This is a little page about my biking activities. I like to track my milage and to take pictures of the places where i go. The biking pictures on the left are a subset from my pictures on <a href="http://dailyfratze.de/michael">dailyfratze.de</a>, all of which are tagged with "Radtour" (Bicycle Tour). The picture will refresh itself every few seconds.</p>
	<p>See more biking pictures at my facebook album <a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=155553&amp;id=535518282&amp;l=6094f409e1">Biking 2010</a> or have a look at my collection of <a href="/tracks">tracks</a>.</p>	
	<p>
	    Since {{ summary.dateOfFirstRecord | date:'mediumDate' }}, i pedalled
	    <strong>{{ summary.total | number:2 }}km</strong>
	    on different bikes.
	</p>	
	<p>This little application is not only about my biking activities, but should also showcase my current skillset as Developer as well. Read more <a href="/about">here</a> or at my <a href="http://info.michael-simons.eu">blog</a>.</p>
