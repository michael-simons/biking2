== Solution Strategy

At the core of _biking2_ is a simple yet powerful domain model based on a few entities of which a "Bike" and it's "Milage" are the most important.

Although data centric, the application resigns from using too much SQL for creating reports, summaries and such but tries to achieve that with new Java 8 features around streams, lambdas and map/reduce functions.

Building the application with Spring Boot is an obvious choice as one of the main <<Quality Goals,quality goals>> is learning about it. But furthermore using Spring Boot as a "framework" for Spring Framework allows concentration on the business logic. On the one hand there is no need to understand a complex XML configuration and on the other hand all building blocks are still put together using dependency injection.

Regarding dependency injection and testability: All injection should be done via constructor injection, setter injection is only allowed when there's no other technical way. This way units under tests can only be correctly instantiated. Otherwise one tends to forget collaborators or even worse: 20 injected attributes may not hurt, but a constructor with 20 parameters will. This hopefully prevents centralized god classes that control pretty much every other aspect of the application.

Spring Boot applications can be packaged as single, fat jar files. Since Spring Boot 1.3 those files contain a startup script and can be directly linked to _/etc/init.d_ on a standard Linux systems which serves <<Technical Constraints,[TC4]>>.

Interoperability will be achieved by using JSON over simple http protocol for the main API. Security is not the main focus of this application. It should be secure enough to prevent others from tempering with the data, confidentiality is not a main concern (read: passwords can be transmitted in plain over http).

The internal single page application shall be implemented using AngularJS. The deployable artifact will contain this application so there is no need for hosting a second webserver for the static files.

For real time tracking the MQTT protocol will be used which is part of Apache ActiveMQ, supported out of the box by Spring Messaging.

Graphing should not be implemented here but instead the http://www.highcharts.com[Highcharts] library should be used. The configuration for all charts should be computed server side.
