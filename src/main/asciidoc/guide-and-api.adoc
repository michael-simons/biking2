[[introduction]]
== Introduction

http://biking.michael-simons.eu[biking.michael-simons.eu] is a project for 

* tracking my bike activities
* evaluating technology

For my information see http://info.michael-simons.eu/2014/02/20/developing-a-web-application-with-spring-boot-angularjs-and-java-8/[this blog post] as a starting point.

I'd like to thank all the people working at the Spring Eco System for doing their amazing work.
