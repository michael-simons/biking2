== Building Block View

The application packaged as _biking2.jar_ contains two (the api and the spa) of three main parts, as shown in the <<Business Context>>:

From those two we have a closer look at the api only. For details regarding the structure of an AngularJS 1.2.x application, have a look at their https://code.angularjs.org/1.2.28/docs/guide[developers guide].

=== Whitebox biking2::api

The following diagram shows the main building blocks of the system and their interdependencies:

image::5.1_level1-biking_api.png[align="center"]

I used _functional decomposition_ to separate responsibilities. The single parts of the api are all encapsulated in their own components, represented as Java packages.

All components depend on a standard JPA EntityManager and some on local file storage. I won't go into detail for those blackboxes.

Contained blackboxes::

[cols="1,3"]
.biking2::api building blocks
|===
| bikes | Managing bikes, adding monthly milages, computing statistics and generating charts.
| tracks | Uploading tracks (TCX files), converting to GPX, providing an oEmbed interface.
| trips | Managing assorted trips.
| locations | MQTT and STOMP interface for creating new locations and providing them in real time on websockets via stomp.
| bikingPictures | Reading biking pictures from an RSS feed provided by _Daily Fratze_ and providing an API to them.
| galleryPictures | Uploading and managing arbitrary pictures
|===

Interfaces::
[cols="1,3" options="header"]
.biking2::Interfaces
|===
| Interface | Description
| bikes Api | REST api containing methods for reading, adding and decommissioning bikes and for adding milages to single bikes.
| tracks Api | REST api for uploading and reading TCX files.
| trips Api  | REST api for adding new trips.
| oEmbed    | HTTP based oEmbed interface, generating URLs with embeddable content.
| Real time locations | WebSocket / STOMP based interface on which new locations are published.
| Real time location updates | MQTT interface to which MQTT compatible systems like http://owntracks.org[OwnTracks] can offer location updates.
| RSS feed reader | Needs an _Daily Fratze_ OAuth token for accessing a RSS feed containing biking pictures which are than grabbed from _Daily Fratze_.
| galleryPictures Api | REST api for uploading and reading arbitrary image files (pictures related to biking).

=== Level 2

[role="arc42help"]
****
Describe all building blocks comprising level 1 as a series of white box templates. The structure is given below for three building blocks and should be duplicated as needed.

==== Building Block Name 1 (White Box Description)

[role="arc42help"]
****
Shows the inner workings of the building block in form of a diagrams with local building blocks 1 – n, as well as their relationships and interdependencies.

It is also useful to list the most important reasons that led to this structure, esp. as relevant to the interdependencies / relationships among the building blocks at this level.

You should also mention rejected alternatives incl. reasons for their rejection.
